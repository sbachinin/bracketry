LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT CANVAS



Firefox fuckups

    When I tried to draw match images from offscreen canvas using ctx.putImageData, scroll animation got very slow and ugly at FF. Switch back to ctx.drawImage insted of putImageData fixed the issue

    Drawing svgs is risky. If root svg element doesn't contain width and height attributes, FF assumes they are 0 and 0 and thus calling drawImage draws nothing.
