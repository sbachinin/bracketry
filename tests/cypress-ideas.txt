// TODO

compare screenshots of connection lines

(maybe) scrollbar height with a given round height and wrapper height; scrollbar position after scroll. etc
    + scrollbar is draggable

RESIZE => navigation response

click on custom match element => custom event handler is called
    (i do this in Jest with 'dispatchEvent' but it's unreliable.
    There might be disabled pointerEvents due to some parent's style but Jest isn't smart enough to block such a click)

scores' (and subscores') widths are equalized

use classical layout -> matches' vertical margins?

wrapper with auto height -> EP stretches to full height of matches

wrapper auto width -> it probably fills the body widht -> EP stretches to this full width
